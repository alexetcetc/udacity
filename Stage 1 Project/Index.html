            Hi! This is a page about Alex Barrett. Or more specifically, this is his website on the "world wide web".
          </p>
          <p>
            Alex is a Vancouverite at heart, the Canadian one, not the one across the stream from Portland, and currently lives in NYC, where he recently relocated, where he has lived before, but recently came back to, because his boyfriend, Michael, got a job, but Alex does't have a a job, not in New York, so instead of losing his mind during the day, he's learning to code. It pairs nicely with being rejected for jobs. So far so consistent, which, in some endeavours, is a desirable metric.
          </p>
          <p>
            This page will teach you a little about Alex, so read on below!

        <p>The USA is the most civilized country in the world because it has Trader Joes. Alex shops at the Upper West Side location, because the Union Square location is dangerous <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/09/06/world/middleeast/2015-hajj-stampede.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=photo-spot-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news">due to potential crushing in the large wave-like patterns that humans can move in when there's a lot of them in one place.</a></p>
        <p>Alex really likes their <a href="http://www.traderjoes.com/fearless-flyer/article/2353">Penut Butter Pretzel balls</a>, but only the ones without the salt on the pretzel.</p>

        <h3 class="h3Main">Sleeping</h3>
        <p>When Alex sleeps, he requires:
          <ul>
            <li>knee pillow</li>
            <li>head pillow one</li>
            <li>head pillow 2</li>
            <li>arm pillow to support my phone reading arm until I fall asleep</li>
          </ul>

        <h3 class="h3Main">Noise</h3>
        <p>
          Alex is very bothered by noise in general and often wears orange foam earplugs when he's in coffee shops. But he also sometimes does when he's out walking.

        Alex likes movie and TV soundtracks, but that's more or less it when it comes to music. <a href="#"></a>
